# Recursive_ZKP_Frameworks

This repository contains the code used in my paper:  
**_A Performance Analysis on Recursive ZKP Composition_** (2025).

It provides a reproducible framework to evaluate and compare the performance of recursive zero-knowledge proof systems. Currently, **Plonky2** and **Nova** are the only recursive ZKP protocols included in this repository, but I plan on adding more frameworks in the future.
